According to statistics, more than 99% of the population knows this game (if you don't know it, you probably grew up in a cave or are over 80 years old). This game has only 2 basic rules, but they are INVIOLABLE. The first is to tell the truth, only the truth and nothing but the truth. And the second is to have fun until you can't do it anymore. Here's a summary of how 'NEVER HAVE I EVER' Nexus version works:\",\n      paragraph2: \"The first thing you should do is choose the category.\",\n      paragraph3:\n        \"Once inside the game, Nexus will ask questions, which will appear on the screen.\",\n      paragraph4:\n        \"If you have done what appears on the screen, press the 'YES I HAVE DONE IT' button. Otherwise you press 'I HAVE NOT DONE IT'.\",\n      paragraph5:\n        \"Once everyone in the room has responded, Nexus will choose a few to share their story with the group.\",\n      paragraph6:\n        \"Selected people will have the option to share their story with the group. If you have been selected, go ahead and tell us your story.\",\n      paragraph7:\n        \"Nexus is going to reveal your darkest secrets... Just kidding, relax and Nexus will take care of the rest.\",\n    },\n    most_likely_to: {\n      paragraph1:\n        \"If you have ever gone out to a party, surely you know this game. Nexus brings the most popular game to virtuality in a way you've never played before.\",\n      paragraph2: \"The first thing the game host should do is choose the category.\",\n      paragraph3:\n        \"Once inside the game, Nexus will ask questions about 'Who is most likely to perform an action'.\",\n      paragraph4:\n        \"In each of these questions you must vote for who you consider to be the most likely to perform that action.\",\n      paragraph5:\n        \"Once all the members of the room have voted, Nexus will indicate who has been the participant whom the group has chosen.\",\n      paragraph6:\n        \"The chosen participant must tell the other members of the group why he thinks he has been the most voted.\",\n      paragraph7:\n        \"Do you want to know what other people think about you? Try this game and you will be surprised.\",\n    },\n    a_lie: {\n      paragraph1:\n        \"How good of a liar are you? In this game, Nexus rewards your ability to lie and influence the responses of others.\",\n      paragraph2:\n        \"At the beginning, Nexus will choose a participant, who will have to tell 3 different stories or statements about his life. IMPORTANT: One of those stories must be false!\",\n      paragraph3: \"In this game there are 2 roles:\",\n      paragraph4: `It is the participant who must tell the 3 stories. If it is your turn, you must tell your stories or affirmations and select which of those 3 is the lie. (According to the order in which you counted them).`,\n      paragraph5:\n        \"It is the participant who has the responsibility to choose which of the 3 stories is a lie. If it is not your turn to tell the stories, you are a listener. Your duty is to listen (obviously :p) to the 3 stories of who is the narrator and from there, you choose which of the stories is the false one.\",\n      paragraph6:\n        \"If you are a storyteller and nobody identifies your false story, you are a great liar.\",\n      paragraph7:\n        \"If you are a listener and can identify which story is false, you should consider becoming a detective.\",\n    },\n    charades: {\n      paragraph1: `A lot has been said about the verbal language and how it helps us to express our ideas, but what would happen if we had to communicate without making any sounds? Let's explore how good we are to express ourselves without words with charades.`,\n      paragraph2: `One player is chosen to act out a word and the others must guess it. Once the player has read the word, he clicks 'Continue'.`,\n      paragraph3: `The other players will have 1 minute to guess the word by typing it in the chat.`,\n      paragraph4: `After 1 minute, the players who guessed the word will be displayed.`,\n      paragraph5: `Let's see how good the non-verbal language is in this room.`,\n    },\n    hypotethically: {\n      paragraph1:\n        \"There are those who say that to know a person it is enough to see what they do, or in this case, what they would do. With this game, Nexus explores the hypothetical field.\",\n      paragraph2:\n        \"First of all, the host of the game must choose a category. Once chosen, Nexus will randomly select one player each round to answer a hypothetical question that will be displayed on screen.\",\n      paragraph3:\n        \"The idea is that the person answers and justifies his answer and the other members of the room can comment on it.\",\n      paragraph4: \"After answering, click on the “NEXT” button.\",\n    },\n    think_fast: {\n      paragraph1: `This time, Nexus will put your skills to the test. In think fast, the one who knows the most does not win, but the one who responds the fastest.`,\n      paragraph2: `Each round, Nexus gives out a theme. Each Internet user must respond to the topic given by Nexus in less than 10 seconds. On the screen, it will indicate who takes the turn and who is next.`,\n      paragraph3: `Every time it is your turn, you must answer (out loud) and once you have answered you must click on the button \"I already said the word\".`,\n      paragraph4: `In this way, the turn passes to the next Internet user until one cannot respond. Every time you cannot respond, you will be accumulating \"Radioactive Bombs\", which are toxic in high doses. The game ends when a user reaches a certain number of radioactive bombs (you can adjust it manually in the bar below) .

At Nexus we are aware that pleasure lies in the difference and we have decided to take the debates to the next level.`,\n      paragraph3: `Each round, Nexus will display a statement, which Internet users must indicate if they agree or disagree.`,\n      paragraph4: `Once all Internet users choose their answers (Agree or No), Nexus will choose 2 Internet users. One who answered “Agree” and another who answered “Disagree to share their points of view and try to convince others that their position is the best.`,\n      paragraph5: `The idea of the debate is to better understand the preferences of each Internet user and have fun while exchanging ideas.`,\n    },\n    who_am_i: {\n      paragraph1: `Each round Nexus will select an Internet user who will have to guess a character only by asking other Internet users questions. The questions should be formulated as follows: Am I ____? Example: Am I a contemporary politician? When you think you know the answer, you must write it in the box that will appear under your camera. Try as much as possible since you have to guess in just 1 minute.`,\n      paragraph2: `If it is not your turn, you must be attentive to the questions asked by the Internet user who takes the turn.

The chosen Internet user will appear on a larger screen than the other Internet users.`,\n      paragraph3: `If it is your turn to answer and you have already done so, you must click on the \"Next\" button, to pass the turn to someone else.`,\n      paragraph4: `Meanwhile, the other netizens who are listening to the answer to the question will have the possibility to react to the answer with the following feelings.`,\n      paragraph5: `At the end of the match, Nexus will reward netizens according to the reactions they got.`,\n      paragraph6: `In Nexus the best does not win, the team wins`,\n    },\n    trivia: {\n      paragraph1: `At Nexus, we believe that all human beings are experts at something, even if we don't know it. For this reason, we have created this Trivia that covers everything from the classic rock of the 80s, through Renaissance art to popular video game characters.`,\n      paragraph2: `Each round, Nexus will display a question with 4 answer options. Users must answer the questions by choosing the option that each one considers correct.`,\n      paragraph3: `At the end of each game, Nexus will reward the Internet users with the best scores.
